1. Identify the problem:
- Context
    - Describe the issue
        - Why do we need it ?
            2. Research and refine[look up for solutions and break down the issue even further]
- Focus on logic, not code.
3. Write fake code[pseudocode].
    - Once again, logic, not syntax
4. Test it! Console.log, console.dir
    - Test line by line.Don't move on until you have made this line work.
