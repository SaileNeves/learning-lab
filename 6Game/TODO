    Define the game mechanics:

    The game will be played on a 2D grid.
    The player controls a snake that moves around the grid.
    The snake grows in length each time it eats food.
    The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body.

    Create a wireframe:

    The game board will be a square grid.
    The snake will be a series of connected squares.
    Food will appear randomly on the board.
    The score will be displayed at the top of the screen.

    Break it down into smaller tasks:

    (x)Create the game board using HTML and CSS.
    (X)Create a snake object with initial position and direction.
    Add controls to move the snake in the chosen direction.
    Add logic to make the snake grow when it eats food.
    Add logic to end the game if the snake hits the wall or its own body.
    (x)Add food to the board at random intervals.
    Display the score at the top of the screen.

    Define the data structures:

    Use a 2D array to represent the game board.
    Use an array to represent the snake's body, with each element representing a segment of the snake.
    Use an object to represent the position of the food.
    Use a variable to keep track of the current score.

    Write the code:

    Create the HTML and CSS for the game board.
    Write the code to create the snake object and move it.
    Write the code to make the snake grow and end the game if it hits the wall or its own body.
    Write the code to add food to the board at random intervals.
    Write the code to display the score at the top of the screen.

    Test and debug:

    Test the game thoroughly to make sure it works as intended.
    Debug any issues you encounter, and make any necessary adjustments to improve the game.

    Add finishing touches:

    Add sound effects or animations to make the game more engaging.
    Add a high score board to track the player's progress over time.
